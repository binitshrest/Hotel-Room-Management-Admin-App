         <li>Room type B: 80 Rs per hour</li>

  <li>As per requirement, I created a Page where the admin can book the room which takes the userâ€™s email, room number, start time, and end time and books the room accordingly
      The Price of the booking should update as soon as the user updates any one of the room           number, start time or end time.
      No two bookings should have overlapping start and end time for the same room. </li>
