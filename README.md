      As per requirement, I created a Page where the admin can book the room which takes the userâ€™s email, room number, start time, and end time and books the room accordingly
      The Price of the booking should update as soon as the user updates any one of the room           number, start time or end time.
      No two bookings should have overlapping start and end time for the same room.
  </li>

      <strong>Edit: </strong>As per requirement, Allow admin to edit any variables like user email, room number,start time, end time and correspondingly take confirmation on updated price.
    </li>
    <li>As per requirement, I have implemented below features
    <strong>Delete</strong>: Allow admin to cancel any future booking with the following conditions:
    <ol>
      <li>If the booking start time is more than 48 hrs, Show a complete refund on UI</li>
      <li>If the booking start time is within 24 hrs to 48 hrs, 50% refund on UI</li>
      <li>Else no refund (but admin can still cancel) </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>View:</strong>
      Create a view page for the admin to view all the bookings both upcoming and passed with the following filters
      <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman">
        <li>Filter by room number and room type</li>
        <li>Filter by start time and end time </li>
